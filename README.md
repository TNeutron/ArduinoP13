# [3D Printed] Real-time Satellite Orbit Follower/Tracker with Arduino

# Basic Theory
<p>Before jumping right into the project instructions, let us first take a little walk through how this system works. </p><p><strong>The idea </strong>came to me when I noticed that all the available satellite orbit tracking software(such as: Orbitron, Gpredict and etc) work offline, but they keep asking for TLE updates all the time. After installing this software, you would only have to give your location(Longitude, Latitude) and your current local time. Utilizing the <strong>TLEs</strong>, <strong>Location</strong> & <strong>current time</strong>,<strong> </strong>the algorithm somehow manages to tell you where a satellite is right now and when will it pass over your head. What are these TLE files?</p><p><strong>TLE </strong>stands for <strong>"Two-Line Elements". </strong>I will quote some lines from Wiki regarding the TLE.</p><blockquote> A two-line element set (TLE) is a data format encoding a list of orbital elements of an Earth-orbiting object for a given point in time, the epoch. Using suitable prediction formula, the state (position and velocity) at any point in the past or future can be estimated to some accuracy.</blockquote><p>So, basically these TLE files contain pretty much all you need to calculate a satellite's positional data.</p><p>------</p><p>A bit more regarding the history of TLE - </p><blockquote> In the early 1960s, Max Lane developed mathematical models for <br>predicting the locations of satellites based on a minimal set of data  elements. His first paper on the topic, published in 1965, introduced  the Analytical Drag Theory, which concerned itself primarily with the  effects of drag caused by a spherically-symmetric non-rotating  atmosphere.<br> Lane's models were widely used by the military and NASA starting in the <br>late 1960s. The improved version became the standard model for NORAD in the early 1970s, which ultimately led to the creation of the TLE format.</blockquote><p>------</p><p><strong>Now, how does a TLE file look?</strong> Here is a demo -</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/l3P8TFR.png"></p><p>------</p><p><strong>These look like random numbers, what do they even mean?</strong> </p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/SSapplications/Post/JavaSSOP/SSOP_Help/2line.gif"></p><p>More Details about TLE can be found on <a href="https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/SSapplications/Post/JavaSSOP/SSOP_Help/tle_def.html">NASA's website here</a>.</p><p>------</p><p><strong>Alright, now the numbers mean something! But, what?</strong> To understand that, we need a little geometry and conics. LEO satellites orbit are of elliptical shape. let's look at an ellipse: </p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/charts-diagrams/20140914_kepler_ellipse.png"></p><p><strong>We have seen an ellipse. Now, how do we apply the idea of the earth and a satellite with this?</strong> Well, here is how:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/charts-diagrams/20140914_500px-Orbit1.png"></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QrEFu.png" style="width: 540.0px;"></p><p>More Details at <a href="https://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2012/3380.html">Planetary Society website</a></p><p>------</p><p><strong>Owwwwkay, now I can relate those "random numbers" of the TLE files with something real. How does the calculation really work?</strong></p><p>Well, a few things to notice here are that, satellites have very well-defined orbits associated with them. The earth has its own rotation too, therefore the orbit of the satellite and the earth's rotation combinedly make the satellites orbit the entire earth. Without the earth's rotation, the satellite would just keep on following a well defined elliptical shape without covering all the areas of the earth. </p><p>------</p><p><strong>Great, we have found a pattern and now there should be some kind of mechanics that we can use to calculate satellite positions, right?</strong></p><p>Well, yes! But, I will not go into that because that is quite a huge subject to cover and I am just not qualified enough for it. I do not even claim to understand it entirely. But here is how I did it -</p><p>After doing internet research until now, I found out that all the computation is done using a mathematical model called "<strong>SGP4</strong>" and it has a FORTRAM implementation called "PLAN-13  Satellite Position Calculation Program". </p><p><strong>Mathematical Details of SGP4:</strong> celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/spacetrk.pdf<br><strong>PLAN-13  Satellite Position Calculation Program by James Miller G3RUH:</strong> <a href="https://www.amsat.org/amsat/articles/g3ruh/111.html"> https://www.amsat.org/amsat/articles/g3ruh/111.ht...</a></p><p>Now, at this point, I had to replicate this application into Arduino, but hopefully, I did not have to reinvent the wheel because <strong>Thorsten Godau(DL9SEC)</strong> implemented it in C++ for Arduino. I found it in his Github. </p><p>DL9SEC's Arduino Plan-13 Github project link: <a href="https://github.com/dl9sec/ArduinoP13"> https://github.com/dl9sec/ArduinoP13</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/dl9sec"></a></p><p>Now, let us build our Satellite follower.</p>


# Where to I point at?
<p>Now, we have some ideas about how the Satellite Orbital System works. Now, we need to know how can we actually point to the satellites.</p><p>For that, we need to know only 2 things.</p><ul> 
<li>Elevation</li></ul><ul> 
<li>Azimuth</li></ul><p>I will not go into explaining to them because this picture below will do it better than me.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://www.kindpng.com/picc/m/116-1167759_images-satellite-satellite-nadir-azimuth-elevation-hd-png.png" style="width: 448.0px;"></p><p>Now, note that when the satellite is on the other side of the earth, the elevation will be negative. </p><p>We are only interested to track when it is above our horizon or when the elevation is a positive value.</p>
